### üß† Question:
Which investor appears in the **largest number of unicorns**?

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Procedure:

- **CTE (`exploded_investors`)**:  
  The `select_investors` column contains comma-separated values. This Common Table Expression (CTE) uses `STRING_TO_ARRAY()` combined with `UNNEST()` to split the investor strings into individual rows, creating one row per investor per company.

- **Normalization**:  
  The `TRIM()` function ensures any leading/trailing whitespace is removed from investor names.

- **Aggregation**:  
  The main query groups by investor name and counts the number of times each investor appears (i.e., how many different unicorns they invested in).

- **Sorting and Limiting**:  
  The results are ordered by count in descending order and limited to the **top 10 investors**.

    WHERE select_investors IS NOT NULL
