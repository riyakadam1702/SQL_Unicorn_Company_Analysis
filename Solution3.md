### üß† Problem Statement:
Which company has the **largest difference** between its current valuation and the **average valuation** of its industry?

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Procedure:

- **CTE 1 (`industry_avg`)**:  
  Calculates the average valuation for each industry by joining the `industries` and `funding` tables and grouping by industry.  
  This forms a benchmark to compare individual company valuations against.

- **CTE 2 (`company_with_diff`)**:  
  Joins `companies`, `industries`, and `funding` with `industry_avg`.  
  Computes:
  - Each company‚Äôs actual valuation
  - Its industry average
  - The absolute difference (`valuation_diff`) between the two

- **Main Query**:  
  Retrieves all records from `company_with_diff` and orders them in descending order of `valuation_diff` to highlight the most extreme deviation.
