### Problem Statement:
Identify unicorn companies that are backed by **more than one top-tier investor**, such as **Tiger Global**, **Sequoia**, and **SoftBank**.

---

### Procedure:

1. **Investor Analysis**:
   - Check if each company's `select_investors` string contains any of the three investors using `POSITION(...)`.
2. **Scoring**:
   - Assign a score of 1 for each match using `CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`.
3. **Summation**:
   - Add all three scores to get a `top_tier_count`.
4. **Filter**:
   - Only include companies where `top_tier_count > 1`.
