#  Unicorn Companies Analysis Using SQL

## üìñ Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing data related to unicorn companies ‚Äî privately held startups valued at over $1 billion. Using SQL, we explore various aspects of these companies based on multiple dimensions such as geography, industry, valuation, funding, and time. The analysis aims to derive patterns, trends, and relationships from the dataset by leveraging the power of relational databases and structured queries. It also demonstrates the ability to join datasets, use aggregate functions, apply window functions, and filter meaningful insights from real-world business data.
